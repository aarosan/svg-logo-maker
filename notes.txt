- Currently researching how to get jest to work with ESM since I'm using that format for importing and exporting.
- ChatGPT recommended Babel so I intalled it and added it to package.json
- It got rid of this error "Cannot use import statement outside a module"
- Got this error "You appear to be using a native ECMAScript module configuration file, which is only supported when running Babel asynchronously."
- Now I'm removing Babel and added this under jest: "extensionsToTreatAsEsm": [".js"]
- Back at the start again... changing jest configurations now:
- Changing from ESM to CommonJS
- I learned that inquirer uses ESM
    - I can get around that by using dynamic import
    - Got the dynamic import code from ChatGPT
- Now I'm trying the commonJS inquirer
    - npm install inquirer@6
    - It's working now!
- created a test directory
- updated the testData variable to include { shape: 'circle' }
- I got my first passed test!!
- Finished shape test and passed all 3 shapes
- Adding shapeColor to createShape() and test
- Added text and text color to createLogo()
- Fixed formatting of circle
- Fixed formatting of square
